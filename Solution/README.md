# Quantum Simulation of the H2 Molecule

Our project focuses on simulating the behavior and energy of the H2 molecule in various quantum scenarios. Through this exploration, we've captured key insights into the ground state energy and effects of different perturbations.

## Procedure

### **1. Initial Simulation and Ground State**

- **H2 Molecule**: Simulated the H2 molecule using a quantum approach.

- **VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver)**: Determined the ground state energy of the H2 molecule.

### **2. Trotterisation and Perturbation**

- **Trotterisation**: Applied the Trotterisation method to see the changes in energy due to a perturbation.

- **Time-Dependent Perturbation**: Introduced a time-dependent perturbation to study its effects.

### **3. Application of Magnetic Field**

- **Magnetic Field Orientation**: Applied a magnetic field that transitions from the X to the Z axis.

- **Analysis**: Observed and documented the effect of the changing magnetic field on the ground state energy of the H2 molecule.
